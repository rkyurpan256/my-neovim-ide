feat: settings, remaps, lazy.nvim and plugins

I am beginner. I know nothing John Snow - I did something as a start.

# Changes

---

## Settings

Added smultiple settings for:
- Identation size
- Marker on 80th column
- Line numbering and more...

---

## Remapping

Added remap for:
- Quick returing to NeoVim's file explorer from within a file `<leader> + p + v`

---

## Plugins

For plugin management it uses `lazy.vim`

Added NeoVim plugins:
- `which-key` - short-key helper
- `undotree` - undo/redo tree-like history
- `tokyonight` - a color theme
- `fugitive` - something about GutHub interaction
- `harpoon` - something about easy file navigation with stack history
- `telescope` - fuzzy finder, some kind of search tool
